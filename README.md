# Puppy Tracker
Countdown to the arrival of my new puppy and share pics. 🐾🐶🎉

## Problem Statement
User has friends on multiple social media networks, some who are on some platforms and not others.

User's friends and family also use different mobile OS platforms - some Android, some iOS. 

Sharing with everyone across these platforms can be difficult due to the siloed nature of these systems, and compatability issues acoss text message platforms. 

User would also like to countdown the days till picking up her puppy and track milestones and other important information. 

## Solution
Create a platform agnostic app to share pics and updates of puppy with those who are interested, and to help user store and track information about her puppy's development and milestones.
